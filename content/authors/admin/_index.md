I did my master's study at the [College of Computing and Information Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/cornell-computing-information-science) at Cornell University. Before that, I studied [Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) and minored in Animation at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

I am passionate about applying technologies to solve real-world problems and provide a better experience for people. In my spare hours, I play volleyball, hike, take pretty photos, watch animation movies.

Currently working as software engineer in NYC.
